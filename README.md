## USAGE

```
top left arrow keys for track/library browsing
top right 'mixer' button toggles to the mixer page
bottom right is a shift button and above that a 2nd shift button
```

### MAIN GRID

the main grid is split into two halves, one for each deck. each half is mapped the same


Row | Column 1 | 2           | 3                   | 4
----|----------|-------------|---------------------|---
1   | quantize | keylock     | headphone cue       | load
2   | flanger  | flanger     | gator               | gator
3   | loops 1  | 1/2         | 1/4                 | 1/8
4   | loop in  | loop out    | loop exit/retrigger | deck reverse
5   | hotcue 1 | 2           | 3                   | 4
6   | hotcue 5 | 6           | 7                   | 8
7   | cue      | reset pitch | pitch down          | pitch up
8   | play     | sync        | pitchbend down      | pitchbend up


```
shift + hotcue = delete hotcue
shift2 + hotcue = needle drop for quickly scanning through a track
shift + sync = adjust beatgrid
```

#### with the deck playing:

```
pitchbend = normal pitchbend
shift + pitchbend = pitchbend more
```

#### when the deck is not playing:

```
pitchbend = forward wind/rewind thru the track
shift + pitchbend = very fine fwd/rew to help align beatgrids
```

### MAIN GRID (mixer mode)

the mixer page basically consists of 8 columns of virtual faders ala ableton live.

```
col 1-3: deck A low/mid/high virtual eq faders with eq kills at the top
col 4: volume deck A
col 5: volume deck B
col 6-8: deck B low/mid/high virtual eq faders with eq kills at the top
```
